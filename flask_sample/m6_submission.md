I didn&#39;t added flask, main.py file, due to<br>which even though my GitHub testes were passed, in Heroku the app didn&#39;t&nbsp;<br>deployed. Later I did that too.</div><div>3. I had problem in prod URL from<br>Heroku, which I got after merging dev and prod branch in GitHub.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Link : <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/">https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/</a><br><br><div>Docker serves as a platform to run applications within self-contained and<br>easily transportable containers. To run an application using Docker, you begin by creating<br>a &#39;Dockerfile.&#39;&nbsp;</div><div>This file outlines the application&#39;s environment and the necessary dependencies. Subsequently, you<br>construct a Docker image based on this file, and with the &#39;docker run&#39;<br>command, you initiate a container using the image.&nbsp;</div><div>The application operates inside this container,<br>ensuring uniformity and hassle-free deployment across diverse environments.<br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Link :&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heroku.com/what">https://www.heroku.com/what</a><div><br></div><div>Heroku is a cloud platform chosen for educational settings due to its<br>simplicity, managed services, free tier for small applications, support for various programming languages,<br>scalability, and collaboration features. It simplifies the deployment process, allowing students to focus<br>on coding without dealing with complex infrastructure setup.&nbsp;<div>Heroku&#39;s support for continuous deployment also<br>helps us learn modern development practices.</div><div><br></div></div><div>Heroku was likely chosen for this class because<br>of its user-friendly interface, managed services, free tier for cost-effectiveness, and support for<br>multiple programming languages. It simplifies the deployment process, making it accessible for students<br>who may be new to web development. Additionally, Heroku&#39;s scalability and collaboration features<br>are valuable for educational projects, and its support for continuous deployment aligns with<br>modern development practices. Overall, it offers an ideal platform for students to learn<br>web development without being burdened by infrastructure complexities<br></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Link :&nbsp;https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/</div><div><br></div><div>Flask is a Python web framework, a tool that helps us build<br>web applications.&nbsp;</div><div>In the class, we explored how to define different web pages or<br>routes in your app and link them to Python functions. This framework also<br>allows us to use templates to generate dynamic web pages, making it easy<br>to create consistent, user-friendly web applications.&nbsp;</div><div>We learned how to handle various types of<br>user interactions, like submitting forms or navigating between pages. Additionally, Flask supports building<br>web APIs, which enable your application to interact with other services and apps.<br>All of this makes Flask a valuable tool for web development.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>A Docker file and a GitHub Actions YAML file serve different purposes in<br>the context of software development and deployment. Here are three key comparison points:</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>Docker<br>file: A Docker file is used to define the environment and instructions for<br>building a Docker image. It outlines how to set up the container that<br>will run your application, including the base image, dependencies, and commands to execute<br>when the container starts.<br></div><div>GitHub Actions YAML file: A GitHub Actions YAML file is<br>used to define workflows and automation tasks for your software development process. It<br>specifies when and how to run various actions or jobs, including building and<br>deploying Docker images, testing, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>Scope:</div><div>Docker file: It is focused on the configuration<br>of a single Docker image. It deals with the specifics of containerizing a<br>single application, including its runtime environment and dependencies.<br></div><div>GitHub Actions YAML file: It manages<br>the entire workflow of your development process, which can include multiple steps, such<br>as building, testing, and deploying applications, not limited to Docker containers.</div><div><br></div><div>Execution Environment:</div><div>Docker file:<br>It is executed during the image-building process. When you build a Docker image<br>using a Docker file, it defines what the image will contain, how it's<br>configured, and what the runtime environment looks like.<br></div><div>GitHub Actions YAML file: It is<br>executed within the GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub Actions is a platform for automating<br>various tasks in your development pipeline, and the YAML file specifies the steps<br>to be taken at different stages of your workflow, including interacting with Docker<br>and other tools.</div><div><br></div><div>In summary, a Docker file is used to define the container's<br>environment and contents, while a GitHub Actions YAML file orchestrates the entire software<br>development and deployment workflow. Docker files are specific to containerization, while GitHub Actions<br>YAML files provide a broader automation framework for your software development process.</div><br></td></tr>
